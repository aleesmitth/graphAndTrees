# sampleTree
Cellphone app intended to visualize some data structures currently: bst, avl & directed graph

---
```
stuff to do:
❌bug in avl tree, it breaks when 2 nodes overlap when rotating
❌currently each graph node can only have 1 inner edge
❌no animations
❌no music
```

## Demo
### Binary Search Tree
<p align="center">
  <img src="demoFootage/firstDemo/gifs/bstAdd.gif" span title="adding nodes" width="360" height="600"/>
  <img src="demoFootage/firstDemo/gifs/bstDelete.gif" span title="deleteing nodes" width="360" height="600"/>
</p>

 `the tree preserves correct structure after each insertion/deletion.`
 
---

### AVL Tree
<p align="center">
  <img src="demoFootage/firstDemo/gifs/avlAdd.gif" span title="adding nodes" width="360" height="600"/>
</p>
  <img src="demoFootage/firstDemo/gifs/avlDelete.gif" span title="deleteing nodes" width="360" height="600"/>
</p>

 `the tree stays balanced doing rotations if needed after each insertion/deletion.`

---

### Directed Graph
<p align="center">
  <img src="demoFootage/firstDemo/gifs/digraphMinSearch.gif" span title="adding nodes and using dijkstra" width="360" height="600"/>
</p>

 `it uses dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from node selected(pink node) before clicking the min search button, to the one clicked after.`
